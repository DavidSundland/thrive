                        <p><strong>A problem-solver with a creative bent.</strong> David has returned to his engineering roots, after his passion for urban design took him from Arizona to Illinois and Virginia as a city planner. His love of dogs prompted a second career as a self-employed dog trainer. Then his affinity for live music and frustration with the lack of good online resources for finding concerts guided him to his true calling - as a web developer.</p>
                        <p>David's coding career was launched with the creation of District Concerts, DC's leading music calendar. While the site's revenue generation never met expectations, the experience of teaching himself HTML, CSS, Python, and WordPress in order to build the site inspired him to commit to an immersive program studying the full stack. He is now ready to bring his enthusiasm to Viget as a Front-End Developer Apprentice.</p>

                    <!--                    Yin and Yang. Erica's interests know no bounds or subject-matter limits. At UVA, she studied the unlikely combo of bioethics and interdisciplinary global studies. Now — whether talking shop about creative copywriting or Rails dev — Erica loves hearing people's stories and discussing tech. She helps Viget find great people, and great people find Viget.


Now, he builds apps with rich animations and thoughtful interactions. He's happy to be doing browser testing instead of standardized testing.
Chloe fell in love with the art of code in middle school when she dabbled in HTML and CSS to spruce up her Myspace page. Now, she constructs clean and responsive interfaces that fulfill her passion for well-built design.

                    I just have a lot of feelings. Blair's undergraduate degrees in both English and Communication Design help her concoct ideas, designs, and content with style AND substance.

                    She's been making websites since Geocities was cool. Now she focuses less on scrolling sparkle text and more on intuitive, emotionally driven design. With a penchant for illustration, she breathes life and personality into brands.



                    Our original engineering + design combo. An engineering major and studio art minor was rare at UVA in the mid-90s. This mix became Brian’s career focus when he co-founded Viget to bring together the technical and design talent that clients needed.

                    Brian does everything from leading company direction to advising key clients to meeting every potential hire to making our conference tables with his bare hands. A focused man of many talents or a distracted man of many interests? We may never know.



                    "The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails." A Princeton graduate, Andy co-founded Viget and has served as President ever since. He makes sure clients and staff stay happy and that we can always pay our bills. Sometimes, you'll find him deadpanning our Free Lunch Friday company updates to everyone's delight.

                    Andy actively participates in the Falls Church community. He loves sailing when he's not faithfully steering the Viget ship.




                    Born to PM. On her first trip to Disney World, Claire commandeered the park map, asked each family member to rank attraction priorities, planned the route, then ran ahead to the first ride. She was 5.

                    With a BA in journalism from UNC, Claire now combines her natural people and planning proclivities with her passion for all things digital to manage web and application development projects. Claire still loves trip planning, and running. She's visited 20 countries and run four marathons (so far).
